# JavaScript in <3

Hi! My name's Anna and I <3 JavaScript. I decided to create a series of short videos covering basic JavaScript concepts in under 3 minutes.

This repository will house the example files I use for these videos. As they grow, I will order and organise this repository more.

Thank you for your interest and [please follow me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/AnnaJMcDougall) where you can feel free to ask me anything at all.
