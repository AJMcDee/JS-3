// A string represents a piece of text

let greeting = "Hello fair traveller";

// 'info', "info", and `info` are identical to JavaScript

let str1 = "dogs breakfast"; // If you try to add an apostrophe in "dog's", the string will break
let str2 = "cup of tea";
let str3 = `howdy doody`; // Backticks are next to the 1 on an English keyboard
