// What is a variable?

// A variable represents a piece of information
// Variables are labels

let greeting = "Hello";
console.log(greeting);

// Example 1: My mum
// Different variables and constants can hold the same value

var mum = "Virginia";
const grandma = "Virginia"; // This is technically a constant and not a variable! Be careful!
let marzipan = "Virginia";

console.log(greeting + "Virginia");

// Example 2: "The report"
// A variable can change (vary!) depending on context or results

var theReport = "10 page summary of the news today";
theReport = "A legal case against the Prime Minister of Australia";
theReport = "An environmental impact statement";
